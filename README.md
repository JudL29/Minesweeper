Hello there,

This is a java project created by William, Frank, Frankie, and me at the end summer of '25
The project was to make a computer helper to help to solve a minesweeper map and to hone in our programming skills.
Made some minor improvement from then, but not that drastic

Currently the project helped until there isn't a good way to find a bomb without trying to predict and map probabilities to remaining tiles.
